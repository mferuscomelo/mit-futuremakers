### Day 1 (06.07.2021):
I am looking forward to learning more about AI and its ethical impact on society. I am also hoping the apply the knowledge and skills learned during this program to hands-on project to ensure that I properly understand the material.

### Day 2 (07.07.2021):
Dr. Kong's seminar on leadership taught me how to use storytelling to take action in my community and make a positive difference. 

There are 3 types of callings: A call of us (community), self (leadership), and now (strategy and action). Once you have decided on the calling, you craft a story that has three parts: a choice, a challenge, and an outcome. A moral at the end is a plus. 

This well-planned seminar inspired me to share my own story and experience to become a supportive and encouraging visionary leader.
