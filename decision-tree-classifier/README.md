# Action item for day 3 (08.07.2021) - Classifying flowers

## Description
This model uses a Decision Tree Classifier from Scikit-Learn to classify a flower as Setosa, Versicolor, or Virginica based on the following inputs:
- Sepal length
- Sepal width
- Petal length
- Petal width

To better comprehend the relationships between the data, I implemented a few functions to visualize the inputs in the form of graphs and charts.
